    /* 
In the provided C code, `x` represents the value at which the polynomial is evaluated.

### Explanation:
- A polynomial is typically expressed in the form:
  \[
  P(x) = a_n \cdot x^n + a_{n-1} \cdot x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot x + a_0
  \]
  where `a_n`, `a_{n-1}`, ..., `a_0` are coefficients, and `n`, `n-1`, ..., `0` are the exponents.
  
- The function `evaluatePolynomial()` takes in a list of terms (each term has a coefficient and an exponent), the number of terms, and a specific value of `x` to evaluate the polynomial at that point.

### Example:
Given the polynomial in the code:
\[ 
P(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x 
\]

If you set `x = 2`, the program computes:
\[ 
P(2) = 2(2)^3 - 4(2)^2 + 3(2) 
     = 2(8) - 4(4) + 6 
     = 16 - 16 + 6 
     = 6 
\]

So, `x` is the value that you substitute into the polynomial to calculate the result. In the code, `x` is initialized to `2`, meaning the polynomial is evaluated at `x = 2`. The program then outputs the result of this evaluation, which in this case is `6`.
